There is no hard and fast rule to follow while writing good README.md. 
It is a pointer for me for the future. 

# Project or Task Title
 Write any project description here. ideal will be one or two concise paragraphs. 
 Consider it as an "abstract".

## Project Milestones (optional)
 It is not necessary, but one can add it.

:heavy_check_mark: 
......abc

:heavy_check_mark: 
......abc

## Development status (optional)
Current progress with respect to Milestones.

## Other(s)
Optional points that can be added. 
 
- [Glossary of Important terms - For example](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary )
- Snapshots, GIFs etc
-Badges
```
   Many are not a fan of this practice. But like I said it depends that how to want to explain it.
